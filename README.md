# Anaglygh Mod for Fabric 1.18.x

Adds a blue-yellow anaglyph to Minecraft with settings similar to 1.12.2 and prior versions, configurable via recompilation
(all settings stored in GameRendererMixin).

This is still very much a work in progress, so sorry if I don't release binary versions - getting a copy fresh from GitHub should be as simple
as cloning this repository and running ./gradlew build. For non-developers, please be patient and I'll try to get you something performant and
usable as soon as I can :)
